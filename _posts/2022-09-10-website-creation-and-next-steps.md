I decided to write something in this post after spending several days to have at least, some contents to show.

Currently the website (which expect to become the main source of informations about James Ray) contains:
- A welcome page which display a resume and website news/updates.
- A link to James Ray biography written by Jason Anthony (i need to get he's agreement by the way).
- The list of James Ray songs with Youtube links, informations about the records and few lyrics.
- Photos (newspaper extract for the most, or vinyl cover).
- A references page, where you can find informations, quotes about James Ray or persons related to him.

<br>
Next steps planned:
- Continue the lyrics transcription.
- Fill the About page.
- Buy a domain name (whereisjamesray.net ?).
- Create a social network account (Twitter ?).
- Work on the SEO part for more visibility.
- Contact persons who worked with James Ray, met him, or know persons who possess any informations/documents about him (by far the most important step, and probably the topic of the next update).

<br>
As you can see, there is still a lot of work to do, and if someone is interested and want to join/contribute, please contact me: [remidebord[at]hotmail.fr](mailto:remidebord@hotmail.fr).

Website is hosted by Github, and repo is available here: [github.com/remidebord/whereisjamesray](https://github.com/remidebord/whereisjamesray).

Thank you,

RÃ©mi.
