# James Ray - If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody

Making the move from Washington, D.C. to New York City in 1959, aspiring just-turned-18 singer __James Ray Raymond__ was ushered into a recording studio shortly after arrival, resulting in a single for Gallant, one of __George Goldner's__ labels from the Gone/End/Gee group. As __Little Jimmy Ray__ (his general appearance similar to short-in-stature hitmaker __Little Willie John__, though vocally they were quite dissimilar), his A side ballad ___"Make Her Mine"___ written by singer and __Chantels__ mentor __Richard Barrett__, was flipped with __"You Need to Fall in Love"__ penned by Raymond, its melody and arrangement a blatant imitation of John's signature tune _"Fever"_ But as easy as it had been to break into the business, so was it tough going for the next two years.

James pounded the Big Apple pavement for many months after that one unsuccessful bid, occasionally working in small nightclubs but mostly singing on street corners and, for a time, living on the streets. A music-obsessed mailman, __Rudy Clark__, saw him in a club in 1961, which ultimately worked in James's favor. When __Gerry Granahan__, founder of the recently-established Caprice Records, showed interest in some of Clark's songs but didn't feel he had a voice for recording, Rudy tracked down James, who'd been sacking out on the roof of an apartment building, and took him to audition for Granahan. Caprice had gotten off to a good start that year with hit singles by a pair of female acts from New Jersey, __Janie Grant__ (_"Triangle"_) and The Angels (_"'Til"_). Taking a simplified and less juvenile name, __James Ray__ scored the label's third big hit.

__"If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody"__ the best song in Clark's repertoire, benefited further from an oddball arrangement by __Hutch Davie__ (whose first notable accomplishment was co-composing _"The Green Door"_ and pounding the piano on __Jim Lowe__'s number one hit version in '56). Many of Davie's arrangements went against trend; he often made clever use of horn sections (trumpet blasts, trombone accents). The recording was produced as a waltz and emphasized the tuba and harmonica as lead instruments. The whole thing could have gone horribly wrong, but didn't; Ray's distinctive vocal performance came almost as an afterthought. _"If You Gotta"_ hit the national charts in November 1961 and spent several weeks in the top 30 in January and February '62 while reaching the top ten of the R&B charts. Flip side ___"It's Been a Drag"___ wasn't strong on airplay but Ray's reading of the song's downer message rang true.

Clark composed the follow-up, __"Itty Bitty Pieces"__ which contrasted Ray's gritty vocal sound against pop backing singers and a more conventional band arrangement than its predecessor. A lesser hit, it just missed the top 40 in mid-May. Around this time James popped up in an unlikely place: Janie Grant's spoof of Vitalis hair tonic, _"That Greasy Kid Stuff"_ poked fun at the infamous 1871 meeting of explorer __David Livingstone__ and __H.M. Stanley__ in Africa. James supplied the obvious spoken line _'Dr. Livingstone, I presume!'_ (Janie chiming in with _'...are you still using that greasy kid stuff?'_) and made his last, albeit uncredited, appearance on the charts. The next James Ray single, __"A Miracle"__ fell far below expectations, after which he was switched to Granahan's Dynamic Sound label for __"I've Got My Mind Set on You"__ another Rudy Clark song, a failure for Ray but not, as it turned out, for another well-known singer many years later.

While James Ray attempted in vain to build on his promising start, British musicians were busy spreading the word about his songs. __The Beatles__, still pounding the Liverpool pavement in early '62 (and paying their dues in Hamburg, Germany at the Star-Club), began including _"If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody"_ in their set; fascinated by Ray's hit and its mesmerizing harmonica, they used it as a blueprint for their own debut single, _"Love Me Do"_ recorded that summer. A rousing performance of _"If You Gotta"_ at Liverpool's Cavern Club in September did not go unnoticed by __Freddie and the Dreamers__, who were on the bill that night; a somewhat soulless recording of the song became the first major U.K. hit for Freddie and company in the spring of 1963. U.S. artists had a fondness for the tune as well; __Calvin Grayson__'s remake appeared on Capitol in the summer of '65 and __Maxine Brown__ charted with her version at the end of the year. Some went the _"Itty Bitty Pieces"_ route; __The Rockin' Berries__ released a pop version in late 1963, followed a few months later by __Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds__ bluesy variation.

James Ray's later efforts appeared on the Congress label and included __"Do the Monkey"__ (written by Clark with occasional collaborator __Bobby Darin__) and his final single, ___"We Got a Thing Goin' On"___ in 1964. Ray's death occurred sometime afterwards, a drug overdose being the most commonly believed cause. Even the date of this tragedy is uncertain, but he wouldn't have been much older than his mid-twenties, a talented singer mysteriously taken too soon.

Rudy Clark pushed on and realized his dreams, authoring several indelible classics including _"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)"_ (a super-size '64 hit for __Betty Everett__), _"Good Lovin'"_ (penned with __Arthur Resnick__, it was a hit for __The Olympics__ in '65 and a __Young Rascals__ chart-topper a year later), _"Everybody Plays the Fool"_ (__The Main Ingredient__'s signature smash in '72, cowritten with __J.R. Bailey__ and __Ken Williams__) and solid soul shots for __Chuck Jackson__, __Mary Wells__ and __Wilson Pickett__, among others. For years, Beatle __George Harrison__ had planned to record one of his favorite songs, _"Got My Mind Set on You"_ (retitled slightly from Ray's 1962 original); in 1987 he finally did and in January '88 it became the second number one hit in the songwriting career of __Rudy Clark__, simultaneously renewing interest in the superbly unique recordings of __James Ray__.
