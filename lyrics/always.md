# Lyrics - Always

I will be loving you
Always

[Chorus]
_Always_
_With_

With all the love that's true
Always

[Chorus]
_Always_
_When_

When the things you plan

[Chorus]
_Need_

Need a helping hand

[Chorus]
_I'll_

I'll understand
Always

[Chorus]
_Always_
_Days_

Days may not be fair
Always

[Chorus]
_Not be fair_
_That's_

That's when I'll be there
Always

[Chorus]
_Not for_

Not for just an hour

[Chorus]
_No and not_

No and not for just a day

[Chorus]
_And not_

And not for just a year
I said always

[Chorus]
_Always_
_Days may not be fair_

Days may not be fair
Always, always, always, always

[Chorus]
_That's when I'll be there_

That's when I'll be there
Always, and ever, and ever, and ever

[Chorus]
_No_

No, and not for just an hour

[Chorus]
_No_

No, it's gotta be longer than a day

[Chorus]
_Not_

And not for just a year, I'm gonna love you
Oh, how do I love town, talk to you, baby

I wanna love you
Love you, love you, love you

Always, always, always
