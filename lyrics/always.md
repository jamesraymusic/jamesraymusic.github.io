# Lyrics - Always

I will be loving you
Always

[Chorus]
Always

We fall in love thats true
Always

[Chorus]
Always

When the things you plan
Laid up ...
I wont understand
Always

[Chorus]
Always

They may not be fair
Always

[Chorus]
Not be fair

That's why i will be there
Always

[Chorus]
Not for

Not for to send our word
TODO...
