# Lyrics - Without A Song

Without a song, the day will never end
Without a song, The road will never been
When things go wrong, and many got a friend
Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A dark is gone, but he's no good no how
Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
And I'll get along, as sure as a song
Is in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the grass so tall
I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I only know, there ain't no love at all
Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
And I'll get along, as sure as a song
Is in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the grass so tall
I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I only know, there ain't no love at all
Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Without a song

[Chorus]
_Without a song_

Yeah, Without a song
