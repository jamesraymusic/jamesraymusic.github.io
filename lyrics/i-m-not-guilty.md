# Lyrics - (I'm Not) Guilty

She has told you
She has told you
They have told you that i'm running around

She has told you
She has told you
They have told you that i'm putting you down
Stop treating me like I'm all drowned

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Wooo, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Wooo, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Girl, i'm not guilty of what they say about me
No, what they say about me

What they tell you ain't just a gossip
They are just trying to tear us appart
And my darling, if you believe them
Don't you known it's gonna breaking my heart
Stop treating me, girl like I'm all drowned

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Girl, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Girl, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Can't you see i'm not guilty of what they say about me?
No, what they say about me

[Saxophone solo]

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Girl, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

No, no, no, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Cant you see i'm not guilty of what they say about me?
No, What they say about me

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Wo, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

No, no, no, i'm not guilty

[Chorus]
_How do you feel?_

Girl, i'm not guilty
