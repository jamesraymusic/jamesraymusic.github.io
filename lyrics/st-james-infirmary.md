# Lyrics - Saint James Infirmary

It was down in Old Joe's barroom
On the corner by the square
The drinks were served as usual
And a goodly crowd was there

On my left stood John Henry
His eyes were bloodshot out of red
He gave at a proud a mountain
And lays of a word he said

I went down to the St. James Infirmary
Saw my baby there
All streched out on a table
So fail, so cold and so fair

When up to see the doctor
She's very low he said
When back to see my baby
Oh my, she's lay their day

Let her go, let her go and God bless her
Wherever she may be
There never be a lover like her
There never be a lover for me

And now you've heard my story
I take another shot of booz
And if everybody still askin'
I've got Saint James Infirmery blues
