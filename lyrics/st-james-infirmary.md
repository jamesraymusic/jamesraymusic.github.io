# Lyrics - Saint James Infirmary

It was down in Old Joe's barroom
On the corner by the square
The drinks were served as usual
And a goodly crowd was there

On my left stood John Henry
His eyes blood shone out of red
He gazed at the crowd around him
And these are the words he said

I went down to St. James Infirmary
Saw my baby there
All stressed out on a table
So pale, so cold, and so frail

When up to see the doctor
She's very low he said
Went back to see my baby
Oh my, she's lying their [...]

Let her go, let her go and God bless her
Wherever she may be
There'll never be another like her
There'll never be another for me

And now you've heard my story
I'll take another shot of booze
And if anybody happens to ask you
I've got those St. James Infirmary blues
