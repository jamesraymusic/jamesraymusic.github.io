# Lyrics - The Old Man And The Mule

Way, way out in the country
There is a little wooden shack
On the other side of the railroad track
There is a mule [on] the field with an old man on his back

Well, the old, old man in the country
He was [..., pope], night and day
To keep the sun and spew so far away
Every light the old man, and all is needs to pray

And he says: sweat lord, I want so bad
For my [boy] around the shacks i never had
And he said: sweat lord, I want nothing else
Then for my [boy] to make something up himself

Now, day of lord in the city without a lightning ray
The whisky bottle scattered all around is there
If the old man son [...]
And he says: please lord, i want nothing else
Then for my [boy] to make something up himself
