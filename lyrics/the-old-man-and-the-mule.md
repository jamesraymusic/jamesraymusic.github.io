# Lyrics - The Old Man And The Mule

Way, way out in the country, there's a little old wooden shack
On the other side of the railroad track
There is a mule on the field with an old man on his back

Well, the old, old man in the country
He works hard both night and day
To keep his son in school so far away
Every night the old man is on his knees to pray

And he says, I want so bad
For my boy to have the chance I never had
And he said, sweat lord, I want nothing else
Bad for my boy to make something of himself

Now way up north in the city, with eyes of flaming red
The whiskey bottle is scattered all around is bed
Give the old man's son, rest his drunken head
And he says: please lord, i want nothing else
Bad for my boy to make something of himself
