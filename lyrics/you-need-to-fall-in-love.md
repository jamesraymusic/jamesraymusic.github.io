# Lyrics - You Need To Fall In Love

Every star that shines so high
Is getting married in the sky
And maybe we could do the same
if you let me call your name

Baby, you need to fall in love

When your tear drops fall like rain
And you're about to go insane
Because you don't have no one
You can tell your troubles too

Baby, you need to fall in love

There ain't no fun sitting at home
Watching TV all alone
Without a lover to call your own
You better stop, you might blow your top

When you're feeling alone and blue
And you don't know what to do
And you just can't sleep at night
Because your love ain't going right

Baby, you need to fall in love

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, you need to fall in love

Baby, you need to fall in love
