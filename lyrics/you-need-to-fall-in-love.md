# Lyrics - You Need To Fall In Love

Every star [...]
[...]
And baby we could do the thing
if you let me call your name

Baby, you need to fall in love

When your teardrops fall like rain
And you are about to go insane
Because you don't have no one
You can tell your troubles too

Baby, you need to fall in love

There is no [...] sitting at home
Watching TV all alone
Without a lover to call your heart
You better stop, you might blow your [...]

When you are feeling alone and blue
And you don't know what to do
And you just can't sleep at night
Because [...]

Baby, you need to fall in love

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, you need to fall in love

Baby, you need to fall in love
