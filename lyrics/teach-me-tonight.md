# Lyrics - Teach Me Tonight

Did you say I've got a lot to learn
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A, B, C of it
Right down to the X, Y and Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teachers stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A, B, C of it
Right down to the X, Y and Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Come one and teach me tonight
