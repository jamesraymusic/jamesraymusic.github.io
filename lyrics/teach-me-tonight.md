# Lyrics - Teach Me Tonight

Did you say i have got a lot to learn
Well don't think i'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A, B, C of it
Way down to the X, Y and Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

Our skies are black, boy
High above you
If shooting star go bad
[...], I love you

A thousand time accross the sky
One thing isn't there it's clear my love
Sugar teacher [...], my love
Glad you [...], my love
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A, B, C of it
Way down to the X, Y and Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight
