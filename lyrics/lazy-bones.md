# Lyrics - Lazy Bones

Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun
How do you expect to get your day's work done?
You never get your day's work done
Sleepin' in the noon day sun

Oh, lazybones, sleepin' in the shade
How do you expect to get your cornmeal made?
You never get your cornmeal made
Sleepin' in the noon day shade

When taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin'
The bugs fall off of the vine
And when you go fishin', I bet you keep wishin'
The fish won't grab your line

Oh, lazybones, loafin' through the day
How do you expect to make a dime that way
You never make a dime that way
Look at you, you never heard a word I say
