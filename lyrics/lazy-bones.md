# Lyrics - Lazy Bones

Lazy bones, sleeping in the sun
How do you expect to get your day's work done?
You'll never get your day's work done
Sleeping in the noon day sun

Oh, lazybones, sleeping in the shade
How do you expect to get your cornmeal made?
You'll never get your cornmeal made
Sleeping in the noon day shade

When taters need spraying, I bet you keep praying
The bugs fall off of the vine
And when you go fishing, I bet you keep wishing
The fish won't grab your line

Oh, lazy bones, loafing through the day
How do you expect to make a dime that way?
You'll never make a dime that way
Look at him, he never heard a word I said
