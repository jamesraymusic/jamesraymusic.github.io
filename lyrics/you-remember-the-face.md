# Lyrics - You Remember The Face

You remember the face of a friend
By the fun, by the fun that happened
And darling, I remember, you, you, you
Oh, you're a good, good friend, but you're more a good lover too

You remember the face of someone
By the deeds, by the deeds they have done
And darling, I remember, you, you, you
Oh, the sweets, sweets way you thrill me through and through

Darling, I[^1] remember all of you
And I remember everything i still do
You remember the face of a girl
If she changes, if she changes your world

And darling, I remember, you, you, you
Oh you change my world thats why I'm so in love with you

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

[^1]: I could not believe that the second voice heard at mid song is expected (Hutch Davie?).
