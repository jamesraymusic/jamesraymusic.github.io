# Lyrics - One By One

[Chorus]
_One by one_
_One by one_
_One by one_

Oh, the wedding bell

[Chorus]
_One by one_

Took away all my pals

[Chorus]
_One by one_

Oh, those wedding bells ringing

[Chorus]
_One by one_

Breaking up the whole gang

Every Friday we bail by [...]
And party on until saturday
Saturday night the same thing
Man we use to swing, oh

[Chorus]
_One by one_

One by one, those wedding bells
Hooking us
Grabbing us
Snatching us

There was nobody left but me

[Chorus]
_One by one_

First it was Harry and Larry
Until it was Joe and Moe
Until the whole gang was gone
And I was left all alone

Then you came, on the scene
The prettiest thing, I'd ever seen
You gave me fever
You made me yearn

Now, here comes my turn
And oh

[Chorus]
_One by one_

One by one, those wedding bells

[Chorus]
_One by one_

Hooking us
Grabbing us
Snatching us

There is nobody left at all

[Chorus]
_One by one_
_One by one_
_One by one_
_One by one_
