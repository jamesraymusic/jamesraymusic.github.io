# Lyrics - One By One

[Chorus]
One by one
One by one
One by one

Oooh, the wedding bell

[Chorus]
One by one

Took away all my payne

[Chorus]
One by one

Oooh, those wedding bells ring

[Chorus]
One by one

Breaking up all gang

Every party, we were ...
And party on until saturday
Saturday night the same thing
Men we use to swing, woooo

[Chorus]
One by one

One by one, those wedding days
Look at us
...
Snatching us

There is nobody left but me

[Chorus]
One by one

Ratchet, Harry and larry
Until it was Joe and moe
Until the whole gang was gone
And i was left all alone

Then you came, on the scene
The prettious thing, i have ever seen
You gave me fever
You made me yearn

Now, will comes my turn
And oooh

[Chorus]
One by one

One by one, those wedding days

[Chorus]
One by one

Look at us
...
Snatching us
There is nobody left at all

[Chorus]
One by one
One by one
One by one
