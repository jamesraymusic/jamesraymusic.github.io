# Lyrics - Come Rain Or Come Shine

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
But wouldn't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we are out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
But wouldn't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we are out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
