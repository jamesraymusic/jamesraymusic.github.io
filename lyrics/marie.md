# Lyrics - Marie

I've got a girl and her name is sweet Marie

[Chorus]
_Ahah_

I've got a girl and her name is sweet Marie

[Chorus]
_Ahah_

We've been out all night as anyone can see

[Chorus]
_Ahah_

I'm talking about Marie

[Chorus]
_Marie?_

Marie

[Chorus]
_Marie?_

Marie

[Chorus]
_Marie?_

Marie

[Chorus]
_Marie, Marie, ..._

Oh, Marie
Oh, you've been [...]
Oh, Marie, so you'll be waking
I just to find that your heart is aching
And tears are gonna fall
As you recall
The moon and all
It's splender
Oh, and that kiss
So warm and tender
And the words, that you're gonna surrender
To me, my sweet, my sweet, Marie

Marie, Marie, Marie
The dawn is breaking
Ooh, Marie
You'll soon be waking
You're gonna find
That your heart is aching

[Chorus]
_And tears_

And tears

[Chorus]
_will fall_

As gonna fall

[Chorus]
_And you recall_

Ooh, the moon, the moon, the moon
And all it's splender
And your kiss, your kiss
So sweet and tender
And the words, that you're gonna surrender
To me
My sweet Marie

[Chorus]
_Marie, Marie, ..._

You know i'm talking about
You know i'm talking about
I'm talking about
I'm talking about
