Marie, Marie, ...

Oooh, Marie
Oooh, gone the week-end
Oooh, Marie, so you will be away again
I just to find that your heart is ...
Until has gonna fall
As you recall
The moon and all
It's splender
All that kiss
So whole and tender
And the words, haven't you gone surrender
To me, my sweet, my sweet, Marie

Marie, Marie, Marie

Ooh, Marie
You soon gonna be a week end

Indeed

Empty

You fall

As gonna fall

And you recall

Ooh, the moon, the moon, the moon
And all it's splender
And your kiss, your kiss
So sweet and tender
And the word, that you gonna surrender
To me
my sweet Marie

[Chorus]
Marie, Marie, ...

You know i'm talking about
You know i'm talking about
