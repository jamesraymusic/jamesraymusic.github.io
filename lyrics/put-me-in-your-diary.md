# Lyrics - Put Me In Your Diary

Put me in your diary
On a page on my own
And below my name
Write big and plain
I used to be his own

Put me in your diary
Make a note and leave it fair
For the day will come
When you'll need someone
And you remember how I care

As I walk away from you now
There's' only one thing left to say
We were meant to love each other
And you'll realize it one day
So, honey, put me in your diary

And take care of yourself until then
To remind once more
Just like before
But never to part again
