# Lyrics - Itty Bitty Pieces

_(You're breaking me up_
_And I don't mean maybe_
_It's too late)..._
Little itty bitty pieces, baby

First, you promise me your love
And then you don't stick to it
When I'm floating on a cloud
You put a hole right through it
Then you say you're gonna thrill me
And you just don't do it
Let me tell you about my mind reactin' to it

[Chorus]
_I'm about to..._
_Go to pieces, go to pieces_
_Go to pieces, wooooo_
_You're breaking me up_
_And I don't mean maybe_
_Into little itty bitty pieces, baby_

When your kisses start to gettin' good
That's when you end it
When you know how much on you, my dear
My love depended
Now I've got to take some pills
With tranquilizers in it
That is what my family doctor recommended

[Chorus]
_I'm about to..._
_Go to pieces, go to pieces_
_Go to pieces, wooooo_
_You're breaking me up_
_And I don't mean maybe_
_Into little itty bitty pieces, baby_

Today you want my love
Tomorrow you don't want it
When you know I'm mad about you
And you play upon it
It's been a long, long time
Since I waited on it
Don't you know how much I need you
Dog gone it

I'm about to go to pieces,
Go to pieces, go to pieces
Oh, you're breaking me up 
And I don't mean maybe 
Into little itty bitty pieces, baby
