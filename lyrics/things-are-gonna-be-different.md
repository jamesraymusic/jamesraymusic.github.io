# Lyrics - Things Are gonna Be Different

Things are gonna be different

[Chorus]
Oh Yeah

Come the break of day

[Chorus]
Oh Yeah

Gonna pick up a new style

[Chorus]
Gonna pick up a new style

Gonna change it in every way

I'm gonna to teach myself to a listen to a new kind of music
And every chance I've get to be different, I'm gonna use it

Things are gonna be different
Come the break of day
Gonna make this the last night
Gonna climb my heart away

And [...] all night doesn't bring me consolation
I'm gonna give [...] a little consideration

Somebody around here gonna be surprise
They will never gonna see a love tear in my eyes

Things are gonna be different
Come the break of day
Gonna make this the last night
Gonna climb my heart away

And [...] all night doesn't bring me consolation
I'm gonna give [...] a little consideration

Things are gonna be different
Come the break of day

Things gonna be different
Come the break of day

Things gonna be different
Come the break of day

[Chorus]
Come the break of day

Come the break of day

[Chorus]
Come the break of day

Come the break of day
