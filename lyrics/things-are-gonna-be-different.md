# Lyrics - Things Are gonna Be Different

Things are gonna be different

[Chorus]
Oh Yeah

Come the break up day

[Chorus]
Oh Yeah

Gonna pick up a new style

[Chorus]
Gonna pick up a new style

Gonna change in every way

I'm gonna to teach myself to a listen to a new kind of music
And every chance I've get to be different, I'm gonna use it

Things are gonna be different
Come the break up day
Gonna make this the last night
Gonna find my heart away

And [they pry] all night doesn't bring me consolation
I'm gonna [give dying] a little consideration

Somebody around here gonna be surprise
They will never gonna see a [love] tear in my eyes

Things are gonna be different
Come the break up day
Gonna make this the last night
Gonna find my heart away

And [they pry] all night doesn't bring me consolation
I'm gonna [give dying] a little consideration

Things are gonna be different
Come the break up day

Things gonna be different
Come the break up day

Things gonna be different
Come the break up day

[Chorus]
Come the break up day

Come the break up day

[Chorus]
Come the break up day

Come the break up day
