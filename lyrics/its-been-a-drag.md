# Lyrics - It's Been A Drag

It's been a drag
It's been a drag

All of my life has been a drag
Each day of my life has been filled with stress and [...]

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and i hang a lot

Heartaches worries have got me down
I'm on the edge of nerves break down

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and i hang a lot

I meet the landlord knocking at my door
And i have to tell him the same thing I told him before
Take it in my pocket, i got a key
Cause it's my lunch and [...] for the rest of the week

Good lord, what is this, the [saint living], i can barely exist

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and i hang a lot

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and i hang a lot
