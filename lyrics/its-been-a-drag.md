# Lyrics - It's Been A Drag

It's been a drag
It's been a drag

All of my life has been a drag
Each day of my life has been filled with stress and strife

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and I ain't alive

Heartaches worries have gotten me down
I'm on the edge of nervous breakdown

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and I ain't alive

I meet the landlord knocking at my door
And i have to tell him the same thing I told him before
The change in my pockets I gotta keep.
Cause it's my lunch and coffee for the rest of the week

Good lord, what is this ? this ain't living, i can barely exist

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and I ain't alive

It's been a drag
It's been a drag, and I ain't alive
