# Lyrics - Do The Monkey

[Monkey sounds]

Walks ...
Way down in ... land
A monkey head in a tree top
And jump down on his man
The heart jump like a goose
But it couldn't check in blues
And that's how the monkey began

Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do
Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do

[Women]
Teach the monkey to me

I teach the monkey to you
Monkey, do the monkey

...
And you down way down
Put your hands on your hips
And you shake it all around
Shake it to the east
Shake it to the west
Shake it to the one you love there

Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do
Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do

[Women]
Play the monkey with me

Yes, i'm monkey with you

Monkey, do the monkey
Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do
Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do

[Women]
Play the monkey with me

Yes, i'm monkey with you

Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do
Monkey, do the monkey
Do the monkey, do
