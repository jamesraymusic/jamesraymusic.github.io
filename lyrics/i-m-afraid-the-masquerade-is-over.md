# Lyrics - (I’m Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_
_And so is all, and so love_

Your eyes don't shine like they use to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is all, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they use to mean
They wont inspire, now they are just routine

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is all, and so is love
I guess i have to play Pagliacci 
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci 
Where tear drops in my eyes

You look the same
You alike the same
But my heart is low
You are not the same

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is all, and so is love
