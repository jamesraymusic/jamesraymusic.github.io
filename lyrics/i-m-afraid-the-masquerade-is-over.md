# Lyrics - (I’m Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_
_And so is love, and so love_

Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is love, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they use to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is love, and so is love
I guess I have to play Pagliacci 
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci 
Where tear drops in my eyes

You look the same
You are like the same
But my heart is low
You are not the same

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is love, and so is love
