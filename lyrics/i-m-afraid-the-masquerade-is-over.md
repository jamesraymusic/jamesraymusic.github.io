# Lyrics - (I’m Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_
_And so is all, and so love_

Your eyes
don't shine
Like they use to shine
And the thrill is gone
When your lips
[...]

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is all, and so is love

Your words
Don't mean
What they use to mean
They want inspire
Now they are just routine

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is all, and so is love
I guess i have to play mariachi
And learn to let like mariachi
Where tear drops in my eyes

You look
the same
You alike
the same
But my heart
is low
You are not
the same

[Chorus]
_I'm afraid the masquerade is over_

And so is all, and so is love
