# Lyrics - Make Her Mine

If I could make her mine
I will be so happy
Cause, I've never know, I never know, I never been in love before

If I could make her mine
I will be so happy
Cause, I've never know, I never know, I never been in love before

But the girl won't notice me
No, no, no, no, no, no the girl won't notice me

If I could walk with her
Even just to talk with her

I know, I could make her, I make her, I make her
I could up make her mine

If i could hold her hand
Just hold her hand

I know, I would make her, I make her, I make her, I make her mine

But the girl won't notice me
No, no, no, no, no, no the girl won't notice me

They say this game of love is a foolish game
Only played by a fool
But if she wants me to play this game of fool
Count me in, count me in, and I will be her fool

If I could make her mine
I will be so happy
Cause, i've never know, I never, never been in love before

If i could hold her hand
Just hold her hand

I know, I can make her, I make her, I make her, I make her mine

But the girl won't notice me
No, no, no, no, no, no the girl won't notice me

No that girl won't notice me

No the girl won't notice me

No that girl won't notice me
