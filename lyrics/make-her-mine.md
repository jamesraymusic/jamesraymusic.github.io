# Lyrics - Make Her Mine

If I could make her mine
I will be so happy
Cause, I've never know, I never know, I never been in love before

If I could make her mine
I will be so happy
Cause, I've never know, I never know, I never been in love before

But the girl wont know this thing
No, no, no, no, no, no the girl wont know this thing

If I could walk with her
Even I just talk with her

I know, I could make her, I make her, I make her, [...] make her mine

If i could hold her hand
Just hold her hand

I know, I would make her, I make her, I make her, I make her mine

But the girl wont know this thing
No, no, no, no, no, no the girl wont know this thing

They say this game of love is a foolish game
Only played by a fool
But if she wants me to play this game of fool
Tell me in, tell me in, and [my heart] will be a fool

If I could make her mine
I will be so happy
Cause, i've never know, I never, never been in love before

If i could hold her hand
Just hold her hand

I know, I can make her, I make her, I make her, I make her mine

But the girl wont know this thing
No, no, no, no, no, no the girl wont know this thing

No that girl wont know this thing

No the girl wont know this thing

No that girl wont know this thing
