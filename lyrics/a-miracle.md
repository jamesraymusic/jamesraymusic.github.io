# Lyrics - A Miracle

All my life I've prayed for
Someone to love
Wondering if my prayers were heard up above

It was a miracle
A miracle
Heaven created a miracle
And sent me down an angel like you

When we met I knew it
Right from the start
You were meant for me
And we'd never part

It was a miracle
A miracle
Heaven created a miracle
And sent you down into my arms

I've never believed in miracles
Oh, but now I do
Because of you

You descended through those heavenly doors
I was blessed to find a love such as yours
It was a miracle
A miracle
Heaven created a miracle
And sent you down for me to love

It was a miracle
A miracle
Heaven created a miracle
And sent you down...
