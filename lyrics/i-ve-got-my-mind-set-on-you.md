# Lyrics - I've Got My Mind Set On You

I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I know what I've got to do

It's gonna take money
Whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take all of your money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, oh yeah

Everywhere I go, you know
Bad luck follows me
Every time I've fallen in love
You know I'm left in misery

This time I really feel
I feel that it's really real
I feel if I put my mind to it
I feel that I really could do it

I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I know what I've got to do

It's gonna take money
Whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take all of your money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

[Chorus]
I've got my mind set on you
I know what I've got to do

It's gonna take money
Whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take all of your money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go you know
Bad luck follows me
Every time I fall in love
I'm left in misery

This time I really feel
I feel that it's really real
I feel if I put my mind to it
I feel that I really could do it

It's gonna take money
Whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take all of your money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, oh yeah
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
