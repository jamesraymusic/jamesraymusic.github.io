# Lyrics - I've Got My Mind Set On You

I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I know what I've got to do

It's gonna take money
Oh, a lot of spending money
It's gonna take hard money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
Oh, a lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, oh yeah

Everywhere I go you know, that love follows me
Every time I've fallen in love, you know, I'm left in misery

This time I really feel
I feel that it's really real
I feel if I put my mind to it
I feel that I really could do it

I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I've got my mind set on you
I know what I've got to do

It's gonna take money
Oh, a lot of spending money
It's gonna take hard money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
Oh, a lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

[Chorus]
_I've got my mind set on you_
_I know what I've got to do_

It's gonna take money
Oh, a lot of spending money
It's gonna take hard money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, oh yeah

[Chorus]
_Everywhere I go you know_
_Bad luck follows me_
_Every time I fall in love_
_I'm left in misery_

This time I really feel
I feel that it's really real
I feel if I put my mind to it
I feel that I really could do it

It's gonna take money
Oh, a lot of spending money
It's gonna take hard money
To do it up right, child

It's gonna take time
Oh, a lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, oh
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, oh yeah
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
