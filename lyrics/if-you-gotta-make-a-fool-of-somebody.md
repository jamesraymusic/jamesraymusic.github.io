# Lyrics - If You Gotta Make A Fool Of Somebody

If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me?
I’m the one that worries, about you

If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me?
I am the one that worries, always true

Daytime or nightime, anytime at all
I’ll rush to your side anytime you call
Just to be near you, you know, anywhere I’ll go
How could you hurt me? so… oh

If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me?
I’m the one that worries, about you

Take it easy baby
Please don’t hurt me
