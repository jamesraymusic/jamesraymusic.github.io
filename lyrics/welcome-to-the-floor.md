# Lyrics - Welcome To The Floor

No, you don't have to be an after [marry?]
If you cant that at all, you just [unworried?]
No, you don't have to be a Fred Astaire
There will be no professionnal out there

Because, this is my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor

And gave [out a spare warning?]
We will stop in early of the morning
If you think you belong and bring a crown
Don't you worry about [...]

Because, this is my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor

There is twisting what a twist if you are a twister
There be mess inside of melody of mess
There is fly with a fly if you are a flyer
Or you can take it slow it doesn't matter Joe

But, you don't have to be an after [marry?]
If you cant that at all, you just [unworried?]
No, you don't have to be a Fred Astaire
There will be no professionnal out there

Because, this is my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor, yeah

There gonna be twisting now
And [...] too

Oooh yeah, you can take it slow it doesn't matter Joe

But, you don't have to be an after [marry?]
If you cant that at all, you just [unworried?]
No, you don't have to be a Fred Astaire
There will be no professionnal out there

Because, this is my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor

Yeah, you are welcome
To the floor
To the floor now
[...]
