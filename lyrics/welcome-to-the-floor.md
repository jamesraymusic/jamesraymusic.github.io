# Lyrics - Welcome To The Floor

If you cant dance at all, you just don't worry
No, you don't have to be afraid to stand
There'll be no professionnals there

Because it's my house, my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor

If you think you'll be lonely, bring your crowd

If you cant dance at all, you just don't worry
No, you don't have to be afraid to stand
There'll' be no professionnals there

Because it's my house, my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor, yeah

There gonna be twisting now
And mashing taters too

Oooh yeah, you can take it slow it doesn't matter Joe

But, you don't have to be an [...]
If you cant dance at all, you just don't worry
No, you don't have to be afraid to stand
There'll be no professionnals there

Because it's my house, my party and my music
And you are welcome to the floor

Yeah, you are welcome
To the floor
To the floor now
to the twist
Mashing taters...
